This requires a dependency on Node, which Python developers might not have on their development machines.</p> <p>The PyPI <code>pyright</code> package was created to solve this problem. When installed, it places 4 proxy executables in the same virtual environment/directory you have your <code>pip</code> in:</p> <ul> <li><code>pyright</code>/<code>pyright-langserver</code> (these have the same names as the originals)</li> <li><code>pyright-python</code>/<code>pyright-python-langserver</code></li> </ul> <p>These proxies will automatically install the actual NPM package if it is not already installed, then re-output the results of the original executables. With the correct configurations, new versions may be automatically installed at runtime.</p> <p>If the corresponding version of the NPM package has not been installed, the proxies will also re-output the \"added 1 package\" notice by NPM, which will cause parsing errors. Due to this, it is recommended that the original executables are used instead.</p> <p>Said original executables can typically be found at:</p> <ul> <li>Windows: <code>%HOMEPATH%/.cache/pyright-python/&lt;version&gt;/node_modules/.bin</code></li> <li>Linux: <code>~/.cache/pyright-python/&lt;version&gt;/node_modules/.bin</code></li> </ul>"},{"location":"faq/#why-does-cli-have-to-perform-saves-so-often","title":"Why does CLI have to perform saves so often?","text":"<p>Pyright only reads actual files on disk.
