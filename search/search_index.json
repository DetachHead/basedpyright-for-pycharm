This requires a dependency on Node, which Python developers might not have on their development machines.</p> <p>The <code>pyright</code> package on PyPI was created to solve this problem. It automatically installs the actual NPM package and places the original executables, named <code>pyright</code>/<code>pyright-langserver</code>, inside the same virtual environment/directory as its own proxies <code>pyright-python</code>/<code>pyright-python-langserver</code>.</p> <p>These proxies will simply output the results of the original executables. With the correct configurations, the originals will be updated automatically.</p> <p>While the command-line interfaces are expected to be the same, it might not be the case. Thus, you are recommended to use the original if you have them.</p>"}]}
