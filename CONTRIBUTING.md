# Contributing

First, thank you! It is thanks to people like you that open source is great.

There are more than one way to contribute to this project;
namely, coding and writing feedbacks/suggestions.

Follow the steps below to get started.


## Coding

Clone the `master` branch:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/InSyncWithFoo/pyright-for-pycharm -b master
```

Then, make your changes. Run the "Run Plugin" run configuration
to start PyCharm in a sandbox with the plugin installed.
It may take a while for the first time.

Open a PR once you are sure that your modifications work correctly.


### Priority

New features, bug fixes, and improvements are always welcome.
However, good tests are most appreciated.


## Feedback

You can also help by installing the unreleased version of the plugin
and report bugs as you come across them.
